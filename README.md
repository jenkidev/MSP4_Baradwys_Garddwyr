## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

* An easy to navigate site where all important features can be accessed through clear and discernable links, no need for back and forward buttons.
* Users should be able to log into an account with default details for shipping and make purchases, they can also read helpful articles. Site admins can log in to an admin account and perform CRUD applications on articles and products.
* All users can view reviews on products and articles.
* All users can sort products and search for them.
* Clear logo which is also used as a favicon.
* Error pages which direct a user back to the home page when a problem occurs.

## Design of Site

The design of the site was inspired by BBC's Gardeners World. This was so it would have interesting articles to help newbie and intermediate gardeners. It would also have appropriate products attached. Full Disclosure: The articles and products for the site were generated using ChatGPT to save time however all code was my own creation adapted from the CodeInstitute Boutique Ado Project.

### Initial idea

The initial idea for this project was to create a gardening resource site. This was to have helpful gardening articles and useful products related to gardening that could be purchased.

### Wireframes

To create the wireframes for this site I used the balsamiq cloud service. This allowed me to create a more basic wireframe. This was helpful as I have found in the past having a more complex and detailed wireframe to be quite restricting.

### Site Layout



### User Path

I used Figma to show a prospective users path through the Baradwys Garddwyr website.

<img src="docs/User_Flow_chart.png">

### Database Structure

I used LucidChart to create the ERD showing how the data would flow and be stored in ElephantSQL.

<img src="docs/Database structure.png">


### Colour Choices

The colour choices were made to emulate BBC Gardeners world lightly with a verdant and fresh feel evocative of gardens.

<img src="docs/Colour pallete.png">

### Fonts

The font choice for this site is Playfair Display with serif as a backup, I chose this font as I beleive it is a clear and easily legible font perfect for a site with articles.

## Technologies Implemented

### Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python

### Tools

* Django - Used to develop the backend infrastructure
* AWS - Created an S3 bucket to store static files for deployment.

For the above error pages ensure that the error pages option is checked in the html checker options.



#### CSS Validation- W3C CSS validation service was used to assess the validity of my CSS code

The below results show no errors in the css code, there are several warnings although these are related to the webkit extensions.

Whole Site CSS - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbaradwys-garddwyr-5f5ecb0daff3.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)


#### JavaScript Validation- JS hint was used to assess the validity of my scripts

All Javascript code passed with a few warning relateds to javascript versioning e.g. only available in ES6


#### Python Validation- 
The CI python linter was used to assess the the validity of my python file whilst development of the site was underway and in progress. Upon project completion the command 'python3 -m flake8' was used to check for formatting and other issues.

As can be seen above most issues raised are caused by lengthy migrations and the local env.


### Performance and Accessibility

Performance and accessibility were tested using google dev tools lighthouse feature.

Below are the results from these tests.

<details><summary>Bag Page</summary><img src="docs/performance/bag_page.png"></details><br>
<details><summary>Checkout Page</summary><img src="docs/performance/checkout_page.png"></details><br>

On analysis of the test many of the lower performance scores were caused by issues rendering high quality images or the images being scaled out of their original aspect ratio to fit withing the cards as displayed on the site.

Lower accessibility scores were caused by contrast errors.

### Device Tests

The website was tested on the following devices:

* Samsung Galaxy M31
* iPhone 12 Pro
* Ipad Pro 4th Gen
* Asus Vivobook laptop (X515JAB_X515JA)
